    ingredients: [
      '2 chicken thighs',
      '2 chicken breasts',
      'Optional: 1 duck breast (preferably wild)',
      '\u00BC\u2013\u00BD cup grapeseed oil',
      '\u00BD cup all-purpose flour',
      '1.5 yellow onion',
      '1.5 green bell pepper',
      '4 ribs of celery',
      '6\u201310 cloves garlic',
      '2\u20133 bay leaves',
      '12 oz amber-style beer or good lager',
      '4 cups chicken stock (preferably that homemade liquid gold)',
      '3\u20135 cups water',
      "\u00BD lb andouille sausage (preferably Savoie\u2019s, Mild)",
      '1 lb kielbasa sausage (optional: buy uncooked, smoke in your Traeger)',
    ],
    notes: [
      'Spicy sausage often makes the gumbo too spicy altogether. Gumbo is typically not super spicy. Can always add hot sauce in your own bowl.',
    ],
    steps: [
      'If smoking your own kielbasa, smoke the sausage at 225\u00B0F for about 2 hours.',
      'After starting the sausage, prepare duck breast by scoring the fat cap and placing on wire mesh rack in a metal pan in the Traeger. Only smoke long enough to start browning the duck, maybe half as long as the sausage. You want to keep the duck fat.',
      'Chicken thighs in smoker at 300\u00B0F for 20 minutes max (not totally cooked \u2014 cooks throughout in gumbo). Alt: Cook in oven at 300\u00B0F for 15\u201320 minutes max.',
      "In that old Magnalite pot, make your roux. Dark dark, yeah, like 80% cacao chocolate. Alt: If no Magnalite, cast iron pot or roaster, or heavy, thick-bottomed stainless steel pot or roaster.",
      "Add the holy trinity: onion, bell pepper, and celery, and stir often until just starting to get soft, but don\u2019t forget the pope\u2026",
      'Add your garlic (the pope) towards the end of cooking down the veggies. Garlic takes less time to soften.',
      'Deglaze the pot with \u00BE of the beer (savoring the rest), scraping the bottom with a wooden spoon until all the browned bits are released. Stir constantly until it returns to a simmer.',
      "Add the stock and the water\u2026 SLOWLY, stirring in a little bit at a time. This helps with mixing the roux with the liquid, and avoids a clumpy finished product. Getting the roux and liquids to mix well can take some finesse, I\u2019ve learned.",
      "IMPORTANT: Never add the stock cold. The roux and stock will not mix well, and you\u2019ll have stringy roux. The only fix is to simmer the gumbo for 5\u20136 hours, which will reduce gumbo liquid 10\u201320%. To avoid this, always add stock at room temp. It\u2019s not a bad idea to microwave on high for 30 seconds.",
      'Add your seasoning: bay leaves, Slap Ya Momma (or other made-in-Louisiana Cajun seasoning), and grind fresh black pepper until your wrists begin to burn.',
      'Add the chicken and chicken fat. Optional \u2014 if using duck: throw away the fat cap from duck breast, add the duck breast and liquid duck fat from the pan.',
      'Bring back to bare simmer.',
      'Simmer on low (1.5\u20132/10 heat) for minimum of 2\u20133 hours, or maximum of 6 hours on lowest temperature. Prevent boil, which burns the roux.',

      'Four pounds of chicken per four quarts of water is the minimum for a good stock. Up to eight pounds yields an even richer, deeper stock.',

      'Refrigerate for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 6 months.',
